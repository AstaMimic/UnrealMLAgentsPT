/**
 * @class URemotePolicy
 * @brief A policy that communicates with a remote server (such as a Python backend) for decision making.
 *
 * The `URemotePolicy` class implements a policy that sends agent observations to a remote server
 * (typically used during training with a Python backend). The remote server processes the observations
 * and sends back the appropriate actions for the agent. This class is responsible for sending requests
 * and receiving decisions from the server.
